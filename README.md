# Javascript Challenge
- In this assignment, I built two web pages that allow users to search UFO sight seeing data by filtering datetime, city, state, country, and shape. For the Level 1 webpage, users can filter by datetime value only. In the Level 2 webpage, users will be able to search data by all 5 conditions. It also contians a reset filter button to clean up the filter and let users to start a new search.
- Technology used in the project is HTML, CSS, Javascript (d3.js).
- This repository contains all files needed for the webpage. Launch index.html in the Level 1 and Level 2 folders, the webpage will show.
